# IT-support-tickets-optimization-with-machine-learning

A potential problem in the current tickets system is that ticket descriptions might be assigned to the incorrect categories. Before I start, I would first describe the general scenario: a staff or a customer would dial “1111” when he/she is going to report a certain technical problem concerning IT systems, services or hardware. After acquiring information from the caller, the analyst will assign the problem to a relevant category and create a ticket which will then be sent to a corresponding team. In some cases, a ticket would go to the
wrong team: for example, a ticket which should have been categorized as a telephone problem is sent to the Windows 10 support team which can do nothing but sending back the problem. Consequently, it would take some additional days to solve the problem and waste the human resources. Therefore, we need to find out some solutions to optimize the present tickets system. Primarily, the project should mainly cover the following three objectives:
(1) Integrate the Machine Learning techniques in the IBM Watson Natural Language Classifier to automatically assign IT Support tickets to some categories.
(2) Examine the output generated from the IBM Watson and analyze the false assignment. Adapt the existing code and train the machine learning models.
(3) Use the trained models to re-entitle categories to support the training of analysts.
